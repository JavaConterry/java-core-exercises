Improve your Java SE and Clean Code skills
### Task
`FileReaders` is an API that allows you to read whole file content into a `String`. Your job is to 
implement the *todo* section of that class.

### Refactoring Task
There is an dirty implementation of class `FileReaders` that **contains bad practices and code smells**. If you want to 
practice in **refactoring** and improve your **clean code skills** you can start from branch **exercise/dirty** instead of 
**master** and try to refactor existing implementation.
  
To verify your implementation, run `FileReadersTest.java`
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to know how to work with text files and be able to write Java code

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and create a branch **exercise/your_username** if you want your code to be reviewed
* Start implementing the **todo** section and verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
